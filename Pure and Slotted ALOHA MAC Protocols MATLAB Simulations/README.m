<h4> This assignment explored Pure and Slotted ALOHA. They differ in that Pure ALOHA allows sending packets as soon as they are generated,
while Slotted ALOHA only allows transmissions at the beginning of a synchronized time slot. Both protocols were simulated on MATLAB for obtaining
the throughput vs offered load curves for varying number of retransmissions counts allowed <strong> (from scratch by Shayma Alteneiji) </strong>. 
We also explored retransmissions with a probability inverse to that of the number of stations waiting to retransmit. This significantly improves throughput 
efficiency, as it stabilizes the channels congestion. </h4>
