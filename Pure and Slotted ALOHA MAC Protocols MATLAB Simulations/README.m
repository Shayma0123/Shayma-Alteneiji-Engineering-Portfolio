Pure and Slotted ALOHA Protocol Simulation

This assignment explores the Pure and Slotted ALOHA medium access protocols. Pure ALOHA allows packets to be transmitted
immediately upon generation, whereas Slotted ALOHA restricts transmissions to the beginning of synchronized time slots.
Both protocols were simulated in MATLAB to obtain throughput versus offered load curves for varying allowed
retransmission counts, <strong> implemented entirely from scratch by Shayma Alteneiji</strong>.

Additionally, a probabilistic retransmission strategy was investigated, where the retransmission probability is inversely
proportional to the number of stations waiting to retransmit. This approach significantly improves throughput efficiency
by stabilizing channel congestion.
