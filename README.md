<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
I’m an Electrical Engineering student driven by a curiosity for how light, materials, and circuits shape the technologies around us.  
I enjoy bridging theory and implementation—breaking complex systems into modular problems, leading small teams, and diving deep into both the physics and algorithms that make hardware intelligent.

<h3>🚀 Featured Project — Senior Design</h3>

<h4>Radar–Camera Data Fusion for Object Localization and Tracking (Extended Kalman Filter)</h4>

<p>
Designed and implemented a multi-sensor fusion system to track moving objects by combining radar and camera measurements.  
The EKF integrates asynchronous data from radar (position, velocity) and camera (centroid detections), while a Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm handles data association.  
Applications include <strong>Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)</strong> and autonomous perception.
</p>

<p><em>Tools:</em> MATLAB, Raspberry Pi, EKF, Constant Acceleration Motion Model, GNN Data Association</p>
