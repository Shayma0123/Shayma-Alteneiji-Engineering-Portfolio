<h3>In this project, we applied the knowledge acquired during the course to design and simulate a circuit using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) to implement a police siren light and a dancing light (astable multivibrator circuit) based on specified requirements. Additionally, we studied the frequency of the astable multivibrator circuit under different design configurations. </h3>
