<h3> This assignment focused on system identification and control design. We identified a system based on a given Bode plot and designed P, PD, and PID controllers to achieve specified phase and gain margins. The performance of the system with each controller was analyzed in terms of static error coefficients, overshoot, settling time, and steady-state errors. </h3> 


<h4> Additionally, we implemented MATLAB programs as an extra feature to design a P controller, a PD controller to satisfy a given phase margin requirement, and determine the gain 
K that makes a given system critically stable.</h4>
